# TESTIMONIALS

### Ishan Piplani ~ Graphic Design & Animation
CodeVisors was my first encounter with any of the online tech forums. As a designer, I've met a number of software engineers in the community who are always willing to help. Every day, they work together on projects, trading talents and experience and aiding in the development of one another's future. It's breathtaking to behold. This is one of the reasons I enjoy helping in my community.

### Prabhjeet Singh ~ Flutter Developer & Deep Learning
CodeVisors is my first experience contributing technological knowledge and its projects. As a developer, I worked on some projects in many different areas by learning and contributing to many communities. But I joined this community because they work together on projects, researching any topics etc. That's the main reason, for helping and contributing my knowledge to the community.
