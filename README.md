# TESTIMONIALS

### Ishan Piplani ~ Graphic Design & Animation
CodeVisors was my first encounter with any of the online tech forums. As a designer, I've met a number of software engineers in the community who are always willing to help. Every day, they work together on projects, trading talents and experience and aiding in the development of one another's future. It's breathtaking to behold. This is one of the reasons I enjoy helping in my community.
